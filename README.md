# SmartAO
A next-gen animation override for OpenSim worlds

##Features
* Fast, no polling, no dataserver
* No notecard needed
* Multiple stands and walks
* Delete current stand or walk
* Sequential or random stands
* Test walks mode
* Sit offset adjustable (handy for pose engines with partners, cars etc)
* Groundsit anywhere (offset adjustable and stored)
* Supports suspend/resume protocols (OC and optionally LockGuard)
* Realistic water resistance when swimming
* Optimized, non-obtrusive mesh HUD
* State loss protection

##Requirements
* RLV or RLVa enabled for sit adjustments, else these buttons have no effect. No relay is needed.
* ubODE physics for water resistance, on old physics engines swimming will be at flying speed.

##Lite version
The lite version is even more optimized, but has no multiple stands or walks
